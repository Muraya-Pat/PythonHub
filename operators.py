# operators in python
# Python supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.
# Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic Operators
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum_result = num1 + num2  # Addition
diff_result = num1 - num2  # Subtraction
prod_result = num1 * num2  # Multiplication
div_result = num1 / num2  # Division
mod_result = num1 % num2  # Modulus
exp_result = num1 ** num2  # Exponentiation
floor_div_result = num1 // num2  # This is floor division itreturns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result

#comparison operators
is_equal = (num1 == num2)  # Equal to
is_not_equal = (num1 != num2)  # Not equal to
is_greater = (num1 > num2)  # Greater than
is_less = (num1 < num2)  # Less than
is_greater_equal = (num1 >= num2)  # Greater than or equal to
is_less_equal = (num1 <= num2)  # Less than or equal to
# Logical Operators
is_true = True
is_false = False
and_result = is_true and is_false  # Logical AND
or_result = is_true or is_false  # Logical OR
not_result = not is_true  # Logical NOT

# assigment operators
assignment = 10  # Assignment
assignment += 5  # Add and assign
assignment -= 3  # Subtract and assign / reduce assignment by 3
